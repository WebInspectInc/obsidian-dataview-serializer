# Obsidian Dataview Serializer

Obsidian plugin that gives you the power of [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), but generates Markdown, making it compatible with Obsidian Publish, and making the links appear on the Graph.

This plugin was inspired by the [Waypoint plugin](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint), which enables something vaguely similar, but without providing as much flexibility.
