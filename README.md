# Obsidian Dataview Serializer

Obsidian plugin that gives you the power of Dataview, but generates Markdown, making it compatible with Obsidian Publish, and making the links appear on the Graph.

## Features

Automatically serialize Dataview queries to Markdown
Currently, this plugin is only compatible with `LIST` and `TABLE` queries. `CALENDAR` queries currently cannot be serialized to Markdown, and `TASK` queries cause issues.
